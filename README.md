## About data
The data is a collection of time series related to medical treatments for kidney failure. The treatments used by clinicians are CVVH, CVVHD, and CVVHDF


## Objective
Predict when a blocking/clotting/clogging event will occur. We need to label the raw data based on some dynamic conditions; this way we can know if at 
time t we have blocking/clotting/clogging. This becomes the time series problem into a Supervised Learning classification problem. This research explores 
how basic ML approaches perform when time temporal order is not considered.
